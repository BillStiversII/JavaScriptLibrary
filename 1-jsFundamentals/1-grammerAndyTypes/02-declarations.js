    note on variables:
            a variable must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign
                numbers may follow the above character, but cannot come first
                javascript is case sensitive - hello and Hello are different variables.
                no spaces are allowed in variable names
                camelCase is the best practice for naming variables
                    camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase
